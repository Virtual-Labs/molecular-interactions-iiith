Physical Chemistry of Molecular Forces
</h1>

<div id="introduction">
	<h2>Introduction </h2>
	<p>

Molecular forces determine the physico-chemical properties of various forms of matter such as gases, liquids and solids. The major focus of this virtual lab is to 
provide a thorough grounding in the fundamental concepts of molecular forces (without using quantum mechanical principles) to undergraduate students and 
introduce them to the optical and magnetic tweezer experimental techniques that are used to measure molecular forces. 
</p>
 <p>
The most stable geometry of a molecule is determined by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces between its atoms. 
The interactions between the atoms of a molecule can be split into two groups, bonded and non-bonded interactions. 
In the former group all intramolecular interactions such as bonds, angles and dihedrals are being taken care of, 
whereas in the latter interactions such as Van der Waals and electrostatics are considered. 
</p>
 <p>
The aim of this lab is to use optical and magnetic tweezer experiments to understand the nature of molecular forces and associated parameters
that quantify the strengths of these atomic interactions.

	<h2>Background</h2> 
	<p>	
In optical tweezer experiments, laser
radiation is used to manipulate single molecules with nanometer precision and measure forces on these molecules with PicoNewton accuracy. 
This ability has opened up several important new areas of study in biophysics and biochemistry. While this technique has been used for over 20 years to 
manipulate and study the properties of micron-sized dielectric particles, it is only recently that this precise force measurement instrument 
has been applied to the study of biological systems.
With the help of optical tweezer experiments we can now observe the activity of single enzyme acting on a DNA molecule and watch tiny molecular motors exert forces on biological molecules. We can directly test the effects of DNA binding proteins on the properties of DNA and use these measurements to determine their energy of interaction.

        <h2>Optical Trap and Force Measurement:</h2>

Radiation pressure is a force per unit area on an object due to the change in momentum of light. All light consists of photons that each has momentum p. For light of specific wavelength ?, the magnitude of the momentum of a single photon is given by<br/><br/>
<b>|p| = h / λ</b><br/><br/>
The intensity of the light is determined by the number of photons passing through a given area per unit time. The momentum flux of photons from light of intensity given by the pointing vector S is<br/><br/>
<b><i>d</i>(<i>d</i>P / <i>d</i>T) = (n / c)S <i>d</i>A</b>
<br/><br/>
where n is the index of refraction,<br/>
c is the speed of light,<br/>
P is the total momentum of the photons, and <br/>
<i>d</i>A is an element of area normal to S<br/>
Thus, in principle one can directly calculate the force on a given area due to the light momentum flux on that area. <br/>
Since the force on a dielectric object is given by the change in momentum of light induced due to refraction of the light by the object, the total force on the object is the difference between the momentum flux entering the object and that leaving the object. The total force on an object due to refraction of light is therefore<br/><br/>
<b>F = (n / c) ∫ ∫ ( S<sub>in</sub> - S<sub>out</sub> ) <i>d</i>A </b><br/><br/>
Thus, if the light coming into a dielectric from a medium of index n is deflected, changing the direction of S when it exits the dielectric, there is a finite force exerted on the object.<br/>
This suggests that light exerts a force on all objects that refract or reflect light. Mostly this force is so much smaller than other forces acting on macroscopic objects that there is no noticeable effect. For example, we can calculate the force due to the change in momentum of light reflecting off of a mirror. In this case,<br/><br/>
<b>S<sub>out</sub> = -S<sub>in</sub> </b>    so,<br/>
<b>F = 2(n / c) ∫ ∫ ( S<sub>in</sub>) <i>d</i>A </b><br/><br/>
The integral represents the total power of the light, which is usually expressed in Watts. In the simple case of 100% reflection, the force is thus<br/> <br/>
<b>F = 2 (n / c)W </b>, where <br/><br/>
W is the intensity of the light in Watts.<br/><br/>
Optical tweezers can be used to directly measure forces on trapped objects. Polystyrene bead that is held at some position away from the focus of the laser beams experiences an attractive force towards the focus. This restoring force is in most cases proportional to the distance between the centre of the sphere and the focus of the lasers. In other words, optical tweezers force can generally be described by the equation:<br/><br/>
<b>F = -kx</b><br/><br/>
Thus, if we can determine the constant k, referred to as the trap stiffness, measuring the position of the bead in the trap determines the force on the bead in the trap.<br/><br/>
